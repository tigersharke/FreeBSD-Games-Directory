# FreeBSD Games Directory
## Synopsis
This idea is a collection of screenshots, animated gifs of play, sample configurations for varying levels of performance, along with descriptions, all for the games available via the FreeBSD ports system.

### Preliminary format
- An html interface will permit fairly easy sort functions in a table and provide access to other features via web browser.
- Added links to places to obtain additional files for use with games or game engines.
- Mechanism for translations of the html content.

### Community involvement
Once this has a framework, at least a few games with their table items, other FreeBSD users are welcome to add.

### Sundry formats - ideas
- reasonable screenshot size/res: 1280x1024?
- Initial description pulled directly from port pkg-descr file.
- can the comment from their Makefile be parsed for inclusion?
- can a general directory list be pulled from the ports directory and used as a starting point?
- how shall the contents be organized?  Seperate directories?
- verbose description unique to the directory, maybe include external links there?
- tags, categories, other sort labels
- more
